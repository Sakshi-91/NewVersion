Additionally, provide a list of dependencies with proper annotations in the format of a pom.xml file that is used for compilation with Maven. The Java API should be exposed on port 8085 and should reuse the backend URL from the C# code. All configurable options should be exposed in a property file. Use HTTP GET methods for the API, and do not use "example" as a directory path. Lastly, provide Git commands to check in these files into the proper folder structure.
