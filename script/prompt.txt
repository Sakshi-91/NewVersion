Below are the C# files for a SOAP web service. Convert them into a Java Spring Boot REST API with main class and appropriate mapping logic and ensure that the file names follow the camel case naming convention and java packages name should be same as C# namespace and do not use 'example' in package name. Controller file should retain exact mapping logic. Additionally, provide a list of dependencies with proper annotations in the format of a pom.xml file that is used for compilation with Maven. The Java API should be exposed on port 8085 and should reuse the backend URL from the C# code. All configurable options should be exposed in a property file. Use HTTP GET method for the API.
