Overview:
The REST API is designed to provide account details based on the account number provided. It uses the SOAP web service definition to define the data types and message structure.

Request Mapping:
- Endpoint: /getAccountDetails
- Method: POST
- Request Body:
  - AccountNumber: string (required)

Response Mappings:
- Success Response:
  - Status Code: 200 OK
  - Response Body:
    - AccountNumber: string
    - AccountType: string
    - AccountBalance: string
    - Phone: string
    - Address:
      - FirstLine: string
      - SecondLine: string
      - Country: string
      - PostalCode: string

API Request Message:
- Name: GetAccountDetails
- Parameters:
  - AccountNumber: string

API Response Message:
- Name: GetAccountDetailsResponse
- Parameters:
  - GetAccountDetailsResult: AccountResponse

Non Functional Design:
- Performance:
  - The API should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests.
  - Caching mechanisms should be implemented to improve response times.
- Scalability:
  - The API should be designed to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
- Reliability:
  - Appropriate error handling and error messages should be implemented.
- Availability:
  - The API should have high availability to ensure it is accessible at all times.
- Security:
  - Authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to secure the API.
  - Input validation should be performed to prevent security vulnerabilities.

Testing Considerations:
- Unit Testing:
  - Test each component and function of the API to ensure they are working correctly.
- Integration Testing:
  - Test the integration between different components of the API.
- Performance Testing:
  - Test the performance and scalability of the API under high load conditions.
- Security Testing:
  - Test the API for any potential security vulnerabilities.
- Error Handling Testing:
  - Test the API's error handling mechanisms to ensure they are working correctly.

Security Aspects:
- Authentication:
  - Implement authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or JWT.
- Authorization:
  - Implement authorization mechanisms to control access to the API.
- Input Validation:
  - Validate and sanitize input data to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks.
- Data Encryption:
  - Encrypt sensitive data to ensure its confidentiality.
- Audit Logging:
  - Implement logging mechanisms to track API usage and detect any suspicious activities.
