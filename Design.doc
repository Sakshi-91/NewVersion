## Overview
The `WebService1` class is a REST controller that handles the GET request for retrieving account details based on the account number. It sends a SOAP request to an external service and parses the SOAP response to create an `AccountResponse` object. The account details are then returned as a response.

## Request Mapping
- GET /GetAccountDetails/{accountNumber}
- Path variable: accountNumber (String)

## Response Mappings
- Success: 200 OK with the `AccountResponse` object
- Error: 500 Internal Server Error

## API Request Message
The API request is a GET request with the account number as a path variable.

## API Response Message
The API response is a JSON object containing the following fields:
- agreementNumber (String)
- agreementType (String)
- balance (String)
- address (Object)
  - addressLine1 (String)
  - addressLine2 (String)
  - country (String)
  - postalCode (String)
- phone (String)

## Non Functional Design
- The controller uses Spring's `RestTemplate` to send the SOAP request and receive the SOAP response.
- The SOAP request is constructed using a formatted XML string.
- The SOAP response is parsed using the `DocumentBuilder` and `Document` classes from the `javax.xml.parsers` package.
- The parsed response is used to create an `AccountResponse` object.

## Testing Considerations
- Unit tests should be written to test the functionality of the `getAccountDetails` method, including handling of different response statuses and parsing of the SOAP response.
- Integration tests can be written to test the interaction between the controller and the external SOAP service.

## Security Aspects
- The controller does not have any security measures implemented. Additional security measures, such as authentication and authorization, should be implemented as per the application's requirements.
