Overview:
The Java code is designed to handle HTTP requests and responses using the Spring MVC framework. It provides various request mappings to handle different endpoints and returns appropriate responses. The code follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

RequestMapping:
1. GET /users/{id} - Retrieves user details by ID
2. POST /users - Creates a new user
3. PUT /users/{id} - Updates user details by ID
4. DELETE /users/{id} - Deletes user by ID

Response Mappings:
1. GET /users/{id} - Returns user details in JSON format
 - Success: 200 OK
 - Not Found: 404 Not Found
2. POST /users - Creates a new user and returns the created user details in JSON format
 - Success: 201 Created
 - Bad Request: 400 Bad Request
3. PUT /users/{id} - Updates user details and returns the updated user details in JSON format
 - Success: 200 OK
 - Not Found: 404 Not Found
4. DELETE /users/{id} - Deletes user by ID
 - Success: 204 No Content
 - Not Found: 404 Not Found

Non Functional Design:
1. Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive user data.
2. Performance: Optimize database queries and use caching to improve response times.
3. Scalability: Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent requests by leveraging load balancing and horizontal scaling techniques.
4. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to provide informative error messages to clients.
5. Logging: Incorporate logging to capture important events and debug issues in the application.

Testing Considerations:
1. Unit Testing: Write unit tests for individual components to ensure their correctness and reliability.
2. Integration Testing: Perform integration tests to validate the interaction between different components of the system.
3. Performance Testing: Conduct performance tests to measure the system's response time and throughput under various load conditions.
4. Security Testing: Perform security tests to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the system can resist attacks.
5. User Acceptance Testing: Involve end-users in testing to ensure the application meets their requirements.

Sequence Diagram:
The sequence diagram illustrates the flow of interactions between the client and the server for a typical request-response cycle.

Activity Diagram:
The activity diagram presents the workflow of the application, including the various steps involved in handling a request and producing a response.

Please note that the actual content of the design document, including detailed explanations and diagrams, would depend on the specific implementation of the Java code.
