Overview:
This design document provides an overview of the Java code and its design. It includes details about the request mapping, response mappings, non-functional design, testing considerations, sequence diagram, and activity diagram.

RequestMapping:
The request mapping section describes the various endpoints of the Java code and their corresponding functionalities. It includes information about the HTTP methods, request parameters, and request bodies.

1. Endpoint: /api/users
 - Method: GET
 - Parameters: None
 - Response: List of User objects

2. Endpoint: /api/users/{id}
 - Method: GET
 - Parameters: id (User ID)
 - Response: User object with matching ID

3. Endpoint: /api/users
 - Method: POST
 - Parameters: User object in the request body
 - Response: Created User object

4. Endpoint: /api/users/{id}
 - Method: PUT
 - Parameters: id (User ID), User object in the request body
 - Response: Updated User object with matching ID

5. Endpoint: /api/users/{id}
 - Method: DELETE
 - Parameters: id (User ID)
 - Response: Success message

Response Mappings:
The response mappings section describes the structure of the responses returned by the Java code. It includes details about the response objects and their attributes.

1. User:
 - id: integer
 - name: string
 - email: string

Non-Functional Design:
The non-functional design section describes the design considerations for the Java code that are not related to the functionality itself. It includes details about performance, security, scalability, and other relevant aspects.

1. Performance: The code should be optimized for efficient execution and response times. Caching mechanisms and database optimizations can be implemented.

2. Security: Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure secure access to the APIs. Input validation should be performed to prevent malicious attacks.

3. Scalability: The code should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests. Load balancing and horizontal scaling techniques can be considered.

Testing Considerations:
The testing considerations section describes the testing approach and considerations for the Java code. It includes details about unit testing, integration testing, and other relevant testing strategies.

1. Unit Testing: Each method and component should be thoroughly unit tested using appropriate testing frameworks. Mocking and stubbing techniques can be used to isolate dependencies.

2. Integration Testing: The APIs should be tested for proper integration with the underlying systems and databases. Realistic test data should be used to ensure accurate results.

Sequence Diagram:
The sequence diagram section provides a visual representation of the interactions between different components or objects in the Java code. It illustrates the flow of control and data during a specific scenario.

Activity Diagram:
The activity diagram section provides a visual representation of the activities or processes performed by the Java code. It illustrates the flow of control and decision points during a specific scenario.

Note: The actual diagrams should be created using appropriate tools and inserted into the document.
