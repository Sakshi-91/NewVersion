Overview:
The XML WSDL definition provided describes a web service called \"WebService1\" that exposes a single operation called \"GetAccountDetails\". This operation accepts an input parameter \"AccountNumber\" and returns an output parameter \"GetAccountDetailsResult\" of type \"AccountResponse\". The \"AccountResponse\" complex type contains information about an account, including account number, account type, account balance, phone number, and address.

RequestMapping:
- HTTP Method: POST
- Endpoint: /getAccountDetails
- Request Body: JSON
- Request Parameters:
  - AccountNumber (string, required): The account number for which details are requested

ResponseMappings:
- Success Response:
  - HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
  - Response Body: JSON
    - AccountNumber (string): The account number
    - AccountType (string): The account type
    - AccountBalance (string): The account balance
    - Phone (string): The phone number
    - Address (object):
      - FirstLine (string): The first line of the address
      - SecondLine (string): The second line of the address
      - Country (string): The country
      - PostalCode (string): The postal code

API Request Message:
- Method: POST
- Endpoint: /getAccountDetails
- Headers:
  - Content-Type: application/json
- Body:
  {
    \"AccountNumber\": \"string\"
  }

API Response Message:
- Success Response:
  - Status Code: 200 OK
  - Body:
    {
      \"AccountNumber\": \"string\",
      \"AccountType\": \"string\",
      \"AccountBalance\": \"string\",
      \"Phone\": \"string\",
      \"Address\": {
        \"FirstLine\": \"string\",
        \"SecondLine\": \"string\",
        \"Country\": \"string\",
        \"PostalCode\": \"string\"
      }
    }

Non-Functional Design:
- Scalability: The REST API should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently. Consider using load balancing and horizontal scaling techniques.
- Performance: The API should be optimized for fast response times. This can be achieved by implementing caching mechanisms, optimizing database queries, and using efficient algorithms.
- Reliability: The API should be designed to be highly available and resilient. Consider implementing fault tolerance mechanisms, such as retry logic and circuit breakers.
- Security: The API should enforce authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the data. Consider using token-based authentication and HTTPS for secure communication.
- Error Handling: The API should return appropriate error responses with meaningful error messages in case of failures or invalid requests. Consider using standardized error code and message formats.

Testing Considerations:
- Unit Testing: Test each component of the API in isolation to ensure they work correctly.
- Integration Testing: Test the API's integration with external systems, such as databases or third-party services.
- Performance Testing: Test the API's performance under different load conditions to ensure it meets the required performance criteria.
- Security Testing: Test the API for vulnerabilities and ensure that all security measures are in place.
- Error Handling Testing: Test the API's response to various error scenarios to ensure proper error handling and error messages.

Security Aspects:
- Authentication: Implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify the identity of the API clients.
- Authorization: Implement authorization mechanisms to control access to the API resources based on user roles and permissions.
- Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Secure Communication: Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server to protect sensitive data from eavesdropping or tampering.
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse or denial of service attacks.
