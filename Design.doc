Overview:
This design document describes the design of a Java code that implements a web service for retrieving account details. The code uses a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file to define the structure of the request and response messages.

RequestMapping:
The web service exposes a single operation called "GetAccountDetails". This operation takes an input parameter called "AccountNumber" and returns an output parameter called "GetAccountDetailsResult".

Response Mappings:
The "GetAccountDetailsResult" parameter is of type "AccountResponse", which is a complex type containing multiple sub-elements. These sub-elements include "AccountNumber", "AccountType", "AccountBalance", "Phone", and "Address".

API Request Message:
The API request message is defined by the "GetAccountDetails" element in the WSDL file. It contains a single element called "AccountNumber" of type "string".

API Response Message:
The API response message is defined by the "GetAccountDetailsResponse" element in the WSDL file. It contains a single element called "GetAccountDetailsResult" of type "AccountResponse".

Non Functional Design:
The non-functional design considerations for this code include performance, scalability, and maintainability. The code should be optimized for efficient execution, capable of handling a large number of concurrent requests, and easy to maintain and extend in the future.

Testing Considerations:
To ensure the functionality and correctness of the code, thorough testing should be performed. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Test cases should cover different scenarios and edge cases to validate the behavior of the code.

Security Aspects:
Security is an important aspect of web services. The code should implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. This may include authentication, encryption, and access control mechanisms.
