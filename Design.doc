## Overview

This document provides a design overview of the REST API based on the provided XML WSDL definition. The API allows users to retrieve account details based on an account number.

## Request Mapping

- Endpoint: `/account-details`
- HTTP Method: `GET`
- Query Parameters:
  - `accountNumber` (string, required): The account number for which to retrieve details.

## Response Mappings

- Success Response (200 OK):
  - Body:
    - `accountNumber` (string): The account number.
    - `accountType` (string): The type of the account.
    - `accountBalance` (string): The current balance of the account.
    - `phone` (string): The phone number associated with the account.
    - `address` (object): The address details associated with the account.
      - `firstLine` (string): The first line of the address.
      - `secondLine` (string): The second line of the address.
      - `country` (string): The country of the address.
      - `postalCode` (string): The postal code of the address.

- Error Response (400 Bad Request):
  - Body:
    - `message` (string): A descriptive error message.

## API Request Message

The API request message is based on the `GetAccountDetails` element in the XML WSDL definition. It consists of a single parameter:

- `accountNumber` (string, required): The account number for which to retrieve details.

## API Response Message

The API response message is based on the `GetAccountDetailsResponse` element in the XML WSDL definition. It consists of the following fields:

- `accountNumber` (string): The account number.
- `accountType` (string): The type of the account.
- `accountBalance` (string): The current balance of the account.
- `phone` (string): The phone number associated with the account.
- `address` (object): The address details associated with the account.
  - `firstLine` (string): The first line of the address.
  - `secondLine` (string): The second line of the address.
  - `country` (string): The country of the address.
  - `postalCode` (string): The postal code of the address.

## Non-Functional Design

- Scalability: The API should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
- Performance: The API should have low latency and respond quickly to requests.
- Reliability: The API should be highly available and resilient to failures.
- Security: The API should implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data.
- Error Handling: The API should provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.

## Testing Considerations

- Unit Testing: Test each component of the API in isolation to ensure they function correctly.
- Integration Testing: Test the API as a whole to ensure all components work together correctly.
- Performance Testing: Test the API's performance under various load conditions to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
- Security Testing: Test the API's security mechanisms to identify vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.

## Security Aspects

- Authentication: Implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify the identity of API consumers.
- Authorization: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to certain API endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
- Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized access.
- Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
