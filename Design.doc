## Overview
This REST API is based on the given XML WSDL definition. It provides functionality to retrieve account details.

## Request Mapping
The API supports a single request mapping:

- **GET /account-details/{accountNumber}**: Retrieves the account details for the specified account number.

## Response Mappings
The API responds with a JSON object containing the following fields:

- **accountNumber**: The account number.
- **accountType**: The type of the account.
- **accountBalance**: The current balance of the account.
- **phone**: The phone number associated with the account.
- **address**: The address associated with the account, including the first line, second line, country, and postal code.

## API Request Message
The API request message is sent as a GET request to the specified endpoint. The account number is provided as a path parameter.

## API Response Message
The API response message is a JSON object containing the account details. The response structure is as follows:

```json
{
  "accountNumber": "string",
  "accountType": "string",
  "accountBalance": "string",
  "phone": "string",
  "address": {
    "firstLine": "string",
    "secondLine": "string",
    "country": "string",
    "postalCode": "string"
  }
}
```

## Non-Functional Design
The REST API is designed to be scalable and performant. It follows RESTful principles and adheres to best practices for API design.

## Testing Considerations
To test the API, the following scenarios should be considered:

1. Valid account number: Test the API with a valid account number and verify that the correct account details are returned.
2. Invalid account number: Test the API with an invalid account number and verify that an appropriate error message is returned.
3. Performance testing: Test the API under high load to ensure it can handle a large number of concurrent requests without degradation in performance.

## Security Aspects
The REST API should be secured using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the account details.
