1. Overview:
The XML WSDL definition provided describes a web service called \"WebService1\" that provides an operation called \"GetAccountDetails\". This operation allows clients to retrieve account details based on an account number provided as input. The response includes various account information such as account number, account type, account balance, phone number, and address.

2. Request Mapping:
The request message for the \"GetAccountDetails\" operation is defined as follows:
- Element: GetAccountDetails
- Complex Type: AccountResponse
- Sequence:
  - AccountNumber (string, optional)

3. Response Mappings:
The response message for the \"GetAccountDetails\" operation is defined as follows:
- Element: GetAccountDetailsResponse
- Complex Type: AccountResponse
- Sequence:
  - AccountNumber (string, optional)
  - AccountType (string, optional)
  - AccountBalance (string, optional)
  - Phone (string, optional)
  - Address (complexType: Address, optional)

4. API Request Message:
The API request message for the \"GetAccountDetails\" operation includes the following parameters:
- AccountNumber (string, optional)

5. API Response Message:
The API response message for the \"GetAccountDetails\" operation includes the following parameters:
- AccountNumber (string, optional)
- AccountType (string, optional)
- AccountBalance (string, optional)
- Phone (string, optional)
- Address (complexType: Address, optional)

6. Non-Functional Design:
The non-functional design considerations for this REST API include:
- Performance: The API should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.
- Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increased load.
- Reliability: The API should be reliable and handle errors gracefully.
- Availability: The API should be highly available and accessible to clients at all times.
- Security: The API should implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data.

7. Testing Considerations:
When testing the REST API, the following considerations should be taken into account:
- Unit Testing: Each component of the API should be thoroughly tested in isolation.
- Integration Testing: The API should be tested in conjunction with other systems it interacts with.
- Performance Testing: The API should be tested under various load conditions to ensure it meets performance requirements.
- Security Testing: The API should be tested for vulnerabilities and potential security issues.
- Error Handling Testing: The API should be tested to verify that it handles errors and exceptions correctly.

8. Security Aspects:
To ensure the security of the REST API, the following measures should be implemented:
- Authentication: Clients should be required to authenticate before accessing the API.
- Authorization: Access to specific API endpoints should be restricted based on user roles and permissions.
- Encryption: Sensitive data should be encrypted during transmission to protect it from unauthorized access.
- Input Validation: All input parameters should be validated to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- Audit Logging: All API requests and responses should be logged for auditing and security analysis purposes.
