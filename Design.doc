## Overview
The XML WSDL definition provided describes a SOAP-based web service called \"WebService1\" with an operation called \"GetAccountDetails\". This design document will outline the necessary steps to create a REST API based on this WSDL definition.

## Request Mapping
The REST API will have a single endpoint:
- Endpoint: /api/account/{accountNumber}
- Method: GET

## Response Mappings
The REST API will return a JSON response with the following structure:
```json
{
  \"accountNumber\": \"string\",
  \"accountType\": \"string\",
  \"accountBalance\": \"string\",
  \"phone\": \"string\",
  \"address\": {
    \"firstLine\": \"string\",
    \"secondLine\": \"string\",
    \"country\": \"string\",
    \"postalCode\": \"string\"
  }
}
```

## API Request Message
The REST API will accept a GET request with the following parameters:
- Path parameter:
  - accountNumber: string (required) - The account number for which to retrieve details.

## API Response Message
The REST API will return a JSON response with the following parameters:
- accountNumber: string - The account number.
- accountType: string - The type of the account.
- accountBalance: string - The current balance of the account.
- phone: string - The phone number associated with the account.
- address:
  - firstLine: string - The first line of the account holder's address.
  - secondLine: string - The second line of the account holder's address.
  - country: string - The country of the account holder's address.
  - postalCode: string - The postal code of the account holder's address.

## Non Functional Design
- The REST API should follow RESTful design principles.
- The API should be scalable and able to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
- The API should be optimized for performance and response times.

## Testing Considerations
- Unit tests should be created to test the functionality of the API.
- Integration tests should be performed to ensure the API works correctly with the underlying system.

## Security Aspects
- The API should implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the API.
- The API should use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data during transit.
