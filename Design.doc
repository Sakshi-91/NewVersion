## Overview
This design document describes the REST API based on the provided XML WSDL definition. The API allows clients to retrieve account details.

## Request Mapping
The API accepts a GET request to the following endpoint:
```
/accounts/{accountNumber}
```
Where `accountNumber` is the account number of the requested account.

## Response Mappings
The API responds with a JSON object containing the following fields:
- `accountNumber` (string): The account number.
- `accountType` (string): The type of the account.
- `accountBalance` (string): The balance of the account.
- `phone` (string): The phone number associated with the account.
- `address` (object): An object representing the address of the account holder, with the following fields:
  - `firstLine` (string): The first line of the address.
  - `secondLine` (string): The second line of the address.
  - `country` (string): The country of the address.
  - `postalCode` (string): The postal code of the address.

## API Request Message
The API expects a GET request to the endpoint `/accounts/{accountNumber}`.

## API Response Message
The API responds with a JSON object containing the account details as described in the \"Response Mappings\" section.

## Non Functional Design
The API should adhere to the following non-functional requirements:
- Performance: The API should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests efficiently.
- Scalability: The API should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing traffic.
- Reliability: The API should be highly available and resilient to failures.
- Security: The API should implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data.

## Testing Considerations
The following considerations should be taken into account when testing the API:
- Unit Testing: Each component of the API should be thoroughly tested in isolation.
- Integration Testing: The API should be tested in conjunction with other systems it interacts with.
- Performance Testing: The API should be tested under various load conditions to ensure it meets performance requirements.
- Security Testing: The API should be tested for vulnerabilities and weaknesses in its security measures.

## Security Aspects
The API should implement the following security measures:
- Authentication: Clients should be required to authenticate before accessing the API.
- Authorization: Clients should only be able to access the account details they are authorized for.
- Encryption: All sensitive data should be encrypted during transmission.
