Overview:
The purpose of this Java code is to provide a brief overview of the design of the system. It includes the architecture, technologies used, and high-level functionality.

Request Mapping:
This section provides a detailed explanation of the request mapping in the Java code. It includes information on the different endpoints, HTTP methods used, and the corresponding functionality.

Response Mappings:
In this section, the different response mappings of the Java code are described. It includes information on the different response codes and their meanings, as well as any specific data structures or formats used in the responses.

Non Functional Design:
This section describes the non-functional design considerations of the Java code. It includes information on performance, scalability, security, and any other relevant non-functional requirements.

Testing Considerations:
In this section, the testing considerations for the Java code are outlined. It includes information on the different types of testing to be performed, such as unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing. It also includes any tools or frameworks used for testing.

Sequence Diagram:
This section provides a sequence diagram that illustrates the flow of control between different components or classes in the Java code. It shows the order in which messages are sent and received and the interactions between different parts of the system.

Activity Diagram:
In this section, an activity diagram is provided to illustrate the workflow or process flow of the Java code. It shows the different activities, decisions, and interactions between different components or classes in the system.

Note: Please provide the specific Java code that needs to be documented in order to create a more accurate design document.
